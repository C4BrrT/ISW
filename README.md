# SudokuISW
# Implementation activity from the Software Infrastructure course. The code is available for further optimisation.
## How to run:
Use the command make in a Linux/Mac terminal to compile "sudoku.c", then use ./sudoku your_input_file. "your_input_file" is the file you want to use to verify if it's correct or not.
    $ make
    $./sudoku input_file
